# mtggplot


The goal of mtggplot is to make it easy to **Magic: the Gathering** related 
colors in plots created with `ggplot2`. Also, it's where I'm creating plots I 
plan on posting on Twitter([@khailper](https://twitter.com/khailper)).

## Installation

You can install  mtggplot from Git/hub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_.packages_github("khailpermtggplot")
```
